# SmileBASIC-3DS-Programs
A collection of the programs I've made for SmileBASIC on the Nintendo 3DS (SmileBASIC 3).
These programs are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Files ending with the extension .BAS are human-readable source code. Files ending with the extension .PRG are raw program files that can be imported into SmileBASIC using the homebrew program SmileBASIC File Manager.

Programs included (this will be updated as I export existing programs and create new ones):
LATE ONE NIGHT:
  Late One Night is a text adventure game, and a faithful recreation of a text adventure game I originally wrote in TI-BASIC on my TI-83+ graphing calculator back in high school that was simply known as Text Adventure, to which I unfortunately lost the source
  code. In Late One Night, you play as a girl who wakes up in the middle of the night with amnesia needing to go to the bathroom, but there may be more to your house than meets the eye! Late One Night is also my most ambitious SmileBASIC program so far, as it
  was the first time I attempted native compatibility with SmileBASIC on the Nintendo Switch (SmileBASIC 4) without needing further adjustments, and apart from an issue with the custom background music, it worked!

CASTLE ESCAPE:
Castle Escape is a text adventure game loosely inspired by the fourth act of Dragon Quest Builders 2. Having sought refuge from the declining god known as the Moon King, he seeks to prevent you from leaving by holding your friend captive in the dungeons. Your
goal is to escape the Moon King's castle, preferably with your friend in tow.
